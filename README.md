OpenAir fetches podcast information from the [PodcastIndex API](https://podcastindex.org/). To run OpenAir, you will need to obtain your own API credentials from PodcastIndex.

**Prerequisites:**

- Flutter development environment set up ([refer to official Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab))
- A **PodcastIndex API Key** and **API Secret**. You can get these by creating a free account at [https://api.podcastindex.org/developer_home](https://api.podcastindex.org/developer_home).
- A **Fyyd API Client ID** and **Client Secret**. You can get these by creating a free account at [https://fyyd.de/](https://fyyd.de/).
