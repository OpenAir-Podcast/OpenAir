# OpenAir Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how OpenAir ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

OpenAir is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, email address, location, or device identifiers.

Specifically:

*   **No Personal Data Collection:** We do not collect any personal data that could directly identify you.
*   **No Usage Data Collection:** We do not collect analytics, crash reports, or usage statistics.
*   **No Third-Party Analytics:** We do not use third-party analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics).
*   **No Advertising:** The App does not display advertisements and therefore does not collect data for advertising purposes.

## 2. Information You Provide (Locally Stored)

All your preferences, subscribed podcasts, listening history, and other app-related data are stored **locally on your device only**. This data is not transmitted to us or any third parties.

## 3. Third-Party Services

OpenAir relies on the following third-party service to provide its core functionality:

*   **PodcastIndex API:** The App fetches podcast information (e.g., podcast titles, descriptions, episode lists, audio URLs) from the PodcastIndex API. When you use the App to browse or search for podcasts, your requests are sent to the PodcastIndex API. We do not control the data collected by PodcastIndex. Please refer to the [PodcastIndex Privacy Policy](https://podcastindex.org/privacy) for more information on their data practices.

*   **Fyyd API (Optional):** For additional podcast discovery, the App may optionally fetch podcast information from the Fyyd API. Similar to PodcastIndex, when you use features that utilize Fyyd, your requests are sent to the Fyyd API. We do not control the data collected by Fyyd. Please refer to the [Fyyd Privacy Policy](https://fyyd.de/privacy) for more information on their data practices.

## 4. Future Cloud Sync Functionality (Not Yet Implemented)

We are exploring the possibility of offering an optional cloud synchronization feature in the future. This feature, if implemented, would allow users to back up and sync their app settings, subscribed podcasts, and other data to a cloud database (e.g., Neon).

**Important Considerations for Future Cloud Sync:**

*   **Optional Opt-in:** This feature would be entirely optional, and you would need to explicitly opt-in to use it.
*   **Data Minimization:** If implemented, we would strive to collect only the necessary data to provide the sync functionality.
*   **Transparency:** We will update this Privacy Policy to clearly describe what data is collected, how it is used, and how it is secured, before any such feature is released.
*   **User Control:** You would have full control over your synced data, including the ability to delete it at any time.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
